# Network Assignment 2 - IRC Server Implementation
Server Branch:
This branch will contain code for the second part of the assignment for creating the irc server. 

Code files:

chatroomServer.py - the code file for the server; run this and keep it running before using the client to connect.


chatroomClient.py - the code file for the client; run multiple instances of this and specify different usernames to emulate a chatroom between different users.
